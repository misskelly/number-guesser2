# Number-Guesser

This was the first pair project of Mod 1 here at Turing. The assignment was to make an interactive guessing game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. There were three phases of the project that could be completed, each increasing in difficulty. The basic point of the game is for the computer to generate a random number and the user to put in two numbers to create a number range and then input their names and their number guesses. We did make the site mobile and we have error messages populating if a user plays the game incorrectly. It's actually a fun game!

This was our second time doing the number-guesser project, and we both felt so much better about the project as a whole. We re-wrote all the code, and being able to write clean functions and get all the way through phase 3 of the project felt like a win. We spent time cleaning up some functions, refactoring JS and HTML, and trying to make some of the functions dynamic. 

One important part of this project is learning the git and github workflow, sharing responsibility and teamwork. We worked together very well, we felt comfortable splitting out functionality and styling the game, we both felt that the code was evenly split between the two of us. 

## Here is our finished product:
